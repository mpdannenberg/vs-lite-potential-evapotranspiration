% Usage: [M,potEv,ndl,cdays] = leakybucket_monthly(syear,eyear,phi,T,P,Mmax,Mmin,alph,m_th,mu_th,rootd,M0)

%
% Inputs:
%   syear = start year of simulation.

%   T = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered mean monthly temperatures (in degEes C)
%   P = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered accumulated monthly precipitation (in mm)
%   E = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered accumulated monthly potential evapotranspiration (in mm) if  using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor, or Hargreaves (overwritten with Thornthwaite otherwise)
%   Mmax = scalar maximum soil moisture held by the soil (in v/v)
%   Mmin = scalar minimum soil moisture (for error-catching) (in v/v)
%   alph = scalar runoff parameter 1 (in inverse months)
%   m_th = scalar runoff parameter 3 (unitless)

%   rootd = scalar root/"bucket" depth (in mm)
%   M0 = initial value for previous month's soil moisture at t = 1 (in v/v)
%
% Outputs:
%   M = soil moisture computed via the CPC Leaky Bucket model (in v/v, 12 x Nyrs)
